A PoC for bash script TAP using sharness

This uses the below project for execution. It is not actively maintained, but neither are any of the alternative projects
https://github.com/chriscool/sharness


I put together a VERY simple bash script with some loops and logic to show how shells scripting can be used to make tests easier.

Once installed, simply run script.sh from the command line
